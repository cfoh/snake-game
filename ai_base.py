'''
This is the AI base class. This module contains:

- `SystemState` class: it is a data structure capturing the one-ring vision of 
  the snake
- `AI_Base`: the base class for all AI player. It provides specification for 
  a subclass to implement own algorithm so that the subclass can plug seamlessly 
  to the environment.

    Parameters:
    value : float
        The initial value of the decaying float number. We assume it
        is a positive value.
    factor : float, optional, default=None
        The decaying factor. If None is specified, the float number will
        not decay.
    minval : float, optional, default=None
        The minimum value of the float. If None is specified, the float
        number can reach zero which is the lowest.
    mode : str
        It can be either "exp" for exponential decaying or "linear" for
        linear decaying. An unrecognized string will cause the value 
        not to decay.

      to exit. The algorithm can print some final statistical info or 
      save some info before the program ends.
